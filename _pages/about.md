__Infrared Vision Motion Capture System for Drone Trajectory Tracking__
[![Watch video](/images/PyQtFrontend.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QF4qJRMAZwg)
I independently developed an infrared vision motion capture system for drone trajectory tracking.This system can provide 120fps positioning with millimeter-level accuracy, enabling the drone to perform autonomous hovering at fixed points or follow predetermined trajectories.I built the system from the ground up, so I'm very familiar with every component, including the motion capture principles and drone control mechanisms.  
I released my code in this [Github Repository](https://github.com/Luo-ouL/Low-Cost-Mocap-Reimplement).

__A ROS2-Based Two-Wheel Drive Robot for 2D LiDAR SLAM and Autonomous Navigation__

I independently developed a vehicle for SLAM and autonomous navigation. Using ROS2 and open-source packages like slam_toolbox and navigation2, I successfully implemented the desired functionality. During this process, I wrote numerous ROS nodes to build this complex system, which gave me a solid understanding of ROS2's communication mechanisms and the basic architecture of SLAM-enabled vehicles.

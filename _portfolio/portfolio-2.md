I independently developed a vehicle for SLAM and autonomous navigation. Using ROS2 and open-source packages like slam_toolbox and navigation2, I successfully implemented the desired functionality. During this process, I wrote numerous ROS nodes to build this complex system, which gave me a solid understanding of ROS2's communication mechanisms and the basic architecture of SLAM-enabled vehicles.

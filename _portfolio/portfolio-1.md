I independently developed an infrared vision motion capture system for drone trajectory tracking.This system can provide 120fps positioning with millimeter-level accuracy, enabling the drone to perform autonomous hovering at fixed points or follow predetermined trajectories.I built the system from the ground up, so I'm very familiar with every component, including the motion capture principles and drone control mechanisms.  

I released my code in the [Github Repository](https://github.com/Luo-ouL/Low-Cost-Mocap-Reimplement).
